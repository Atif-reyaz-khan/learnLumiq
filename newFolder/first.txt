The horse is a domesticated, odd-toed, hoofed mammal. 
It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and 
is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. 
The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today
Foal
A horse of either sex less than one year old. A nursing foal is sometimes called a suckling, and a foal that has been weaned is called a weanling.[13] Most domesticated foals are weaned at five to seven months of age, although foals can be weaned at four months with no adverse physical effects.[14]
Yearling
A horse of either sex that is between one and two years old.[15]
Colt
A male horse under the age of four.[16] A common terminology error is to call any young horse a "colt", when the term actually only refers to young male horses.[17]
Filly
A female horse under the age of four.[13]
Mare
A female horse four years old and older.[18]
Stallion
A non-castrated male horse four years old and older.[19] The term "horse" is sometimes used colloquially to refer specifically to a stallion.[20]
Gelding
A castrated male horse of any age.[13]
